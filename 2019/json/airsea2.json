    "caption": "Satellite image of the 2018 bomb cyclone, taken on January 4, 2018. Bombogenesis (formation of a bomb cyclone) occurs when a midlatitude cyclone rapidly intensifies, dropping at least 24 millibars (a measure of atmospheric pressure) over 24 hours. In the 2018 bomb cyclone, pressure dropped by 53 millibars in 21 hours, one of the fastest ever recorded in the Atlantic. This can happen when a cold air mass collides with a warm air mass, such as air over warm ocean waters.
