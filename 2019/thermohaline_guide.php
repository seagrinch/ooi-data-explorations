<h3>Summary</h3>
<img src="images_thermohaline/large/OOI_Arrays_201905509_GI.jpg" alt="OOI_Arrays_201905509_GI" width="350" class="pull-right thumbnail" />
<p>This exercise is a case study that takes students through the entire learning cycle from invitation to reflection as applied to the development of North Atlantic Deep Water in the Irminger Sea. Several types of  data are presented and students are asked to draw some conclusions (exploration). Students are asked to speculate on the relationship between the wind and different water properties and to identify the seasonal cycle in water temperature (concept invention). Students are challenged to apply what they have learned to another situation (application). This case study requires students to think about the interactions among wind, circulation, and water properties, so at the conclusion students are asked to think about what they have learned about this complexity (reflection).</p>


<h3>Learning Goals</h3>
<p>After engaging with this Data Exploration a student will be able to: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Describe patterns in individual graphs and correlations between the different graphs presented.</li>
  <li>Interpret the provided data.</li>
  <li>Explain the relationship between wind speed forcing and ocean water temperature in the near surface.</li>
  <li>Explain the relationship between ocean water temperature and density.</li>
  <li>Identify the seasonal temperature cycle in ocean water and explain how it varies with water depth.</li>
  <li>Describe the formation of NADW and its contribution to the thermohaline circulation.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Context for Use</h3>
<p>This exercise could be used for either lower level or upper level students. For an introductory course, the activity could be used upon completion of the water properties ocean circulation modules to reinforce concepts covered. For upper level courses such as a Physical Oceanography class, it might be a more stand-alone activity used to stimulate questions and review understanding prior to the introduction of the concept of deep convection.</p>


<h3>Teaching Notes</h3>
<p>Students will need to be familiar with concepts from earlier in the semester including: water properties (temperature and density) and basics of the thermohaline circulation.  Advanced students will benefit from a knowledge of latent heat exchange across the air sea interface.</p>
<p>At the lower level, this activity requires synthesis of a variety of concepts (temperature, density, ocean circulation, surface winds) that may not have been considered together previously. At the upper level students can begin to <em>visualize</em> the process of deep convection.</p>
<p>While the hope is to guide students to a more accurate understanding of the concept, the broader learning goal is in making these connections. After the activity is over, discussion could center around how climate change affects the ocean, and the potential for disruption of the global thermohaline circulation.</p>

    <h3 class="panel-title"><strong>Invitation:</strong> As an introductory activity, you can:</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
    <ul>
      <li>Show a clip of high sea state in the North Atlantic. Invite the students to describe what they observe such as waves and whitecaps.  Ask them to speculate what may be happening at the air-sea interface in terms of winds and the temperatures of both the air and seawater.</li>
      <li>Think back to concepts we've already covered in class that might have something to do with air-sea interactions. Discuss the following prompt with the person next to you: In what ways do you think the atmosphere influences the ocean? What concepts did you discuss that might be in play here?</li>
      <li>Show a T-S diagram with identified water masses to illustrate that water density varies with other water properties.  Remind students they previously learned about water properties such as temperature and salinity.  Ask them which of the properties, salinity or temperature, seems to have the greatest impact on seawater density. What evidence are they basing their answer on?</li>

    <p><strong>Exploration #1</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Students use the widget to examine the ocean and air temperature plots in relation to the seasonal cycle.  During this exploration, allow students to explore with a partner, make predictions, and try to explain their reasoning.</li>
      <li>Have students turn to the person next to them and describe any pattern(s) they observe in how the ocean surface temperature changes as the seasons change and what might cause this pattern. [Students should be able to identify seasonal changes in the temperature along with the time lag associated with this warming or cooling, as well as the impacts on temperature of periods of sustained high winds.]</li>
      <li>Students make predictions about how other physical factors (sea surface temperature and density) will change in response to changes in wind forcing.
        <ul>
          <li>Have students share with a partner what they think the graph of those physical factors will look like over time, and a rationale for each of their predictions. </li>
          <li>Have students make a quick sketch of their predictions with a few notes about the discussion they had with their partner about their rationales so that they can look back at their ideas later.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Exploration #2</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Students use the widget to examine a stacked set of temperature plots as well as a stacked set of density plots. During this exploration, allow students to explore with a partner, make predictions, and try to explain their reasoning.  During the exercise, have students respond to the following prompts:
        <ul>
          <li>What patterns do you observe? How do the patterns compare to the predictions you made in Exploration #1? In what ways were they similar/different? What additional explanations might explain the results?</li>
          <li>Describe how temperature and density change as you go deeper. Which depths show the greatest amount of seasonal change in temperature? Which depths show the least seasonal change in temperature? </li>
        </ul></li>
      <li>Students use the widget to compare the temperature and density plots at each specific depth to see the relationship between temperature and density. During the exercise, have students discuss the following prompts with a partner or small group:
        <ul>
          <li>What happens to the density as the water gets colder?</li>
          <li>How do these identified changes in the seasonal near-surface temperature and density contribute to the development of thermohaline circulation? </li>
          <li>In what season of the year is this temperature/density relationship strongest? How can you explain that?</li>
          <li>What would happen to the development of the thermohaline circulation if the wintertime near-surface temperatures were to become warmer. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Have students discuss in small groups and then lead a whole group discussion with the following prompt: Is there anything they are wondering about having studied the data that they might not yet be able to explain? What more information do they want or need?</li>

<h3>Subject / Topics</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Ocean thermohaline circulation</li>
  <li>Water properties: temperature and density</li>
  <li>Ocean dynamics: formation of North Atlantic Deep Water</li>
</ul>

<p>This exercise could be used to ask students to apply previously learned concepts, such as wind speed, ocean temperature, and density to explain Deep Water Formation. If these topics have not yet been covered, this example can provide the impetus to learn about them. It requires taking information in one form, mostly graphs, and conceptualizing about the Irminger Sea. In introductory classes, instructors may want to have students grapple with one or a couple of the concepts and fill in the details for them on the rest.</p>
<p>In more advanced classes students should be challenged to recall previously learned information and apply it to this problem. Instructors should be ready to jog their memories about the learned information.</p>


<h3>Grade Levels</h3>
<p>Undergraduate students in Introduction to Oceanography courses (for either marine science majors or non-science majors)</p>
<p>This exercise can also be a case study in upper level Physical Oceanography course, where students apply what they have learned about water properties and deep convection.</p>


<h3>Data Scope</h3>
<p>Our scope in exploring ways to use professionally-collected data in our teaching:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Using professionally-collected data in teaching of concepts</li>
  <li>Visualizing data in a user-friendly and authentic way</li>
  <li>Enabling students to interactively engage with data in their learning to see the patterns as they are learning the why</li>
</ul>


<h3>Quantitative Skills</h3>
<p>Most of the quantitative reasoning in this exercise revolves around reading and interpreting graphs.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Students must articulate the seasonal pattern in the data presented as well as its attenuation with depth.</li>
  <li>With the help of the widget students will examine time series of ocean temperature, ocean density, and wind speed. They should see that there is a strong correlation among all three of these variables.</li>
  <li>Students will be able to connect the formation of dense water to the sinking of this water to drive the thermohaline circulation.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Science Explanation</h3>
<p>TBD</p>
