For this activity we will be looking at data from three locations: northern near polar Pacific Ocean (<a href=\"http://oceanobservatories.org/array/global-station-papa/\">Station Papa Array</a>, highlighted in yellow), southern near polar Pacific Ocean (<a href=\"http://oceanobservatories.org/array/global-southern-ocean/\">Southern Ocean Array</a>, highlighted in green), and northern near polar Atlantic Ocean (<a href=\"http://oceanobservatories.org/array/global-irminger-sea/\">Irminger Sea Array</a>, highlighted in blue)."

Below the ocean surface off of Alaska there are multiple oceanographic instruments attached along cables running from the surface down to the seafloor in the Global Station Papa location. This is a drawing to represent the where the different instruments are located in the ocean. Data in this activity were collected from the Subsurface Flanking Mooring A (C, highlighted in yellow) in the center of the drawing. "

In other words, by looking at how much light is given off in the water scientists can determine who is in the water and how much of it there is. They are looking for the presence and amount of microscopic algae (phytoplankton)."
