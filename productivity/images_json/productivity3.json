For this activity we will be looking at data collected from moorings at all six of the stations around the globe: northern near polar Pacific Ocean (<a href=\"http://oceanobservatories.org/array/global-station-papa/\">Station Papa Array</a>); northern temperate Pacific Ocean (<a href=\"http://oceanobservatories.org/array/coastal-endurance/\">Coastal Endurance Array</a>); southern near polar Pacific Ocean (<a href=\"http://oceanobservatories.org/array/global-southern-ocean/\">Southern Ocean Array</a>); northern near polar Atlantic Ocean (<a href=\"http://oceanobservatories.org/array/global-irminger-sea/\">Irminger Sea Array</a>); northern temperate Atlantic Ocean (<a href=\"http://oceanobservatories.org/array/coastal-pioneer/\">Coastal Pioneer Array</a>); southern near polar Atlantic Ocean (<a href=\"http://oceanobservatories.org/array/global-argentine-basin/\">Argentine Basin Array</a>)."

The instrument on the moorings around the world that collected data in this activity are included in the Instrument Package (highlighted in red), which is attached to the cable 7m below the water surface. Image is of the Washington Offshore Shelf Surface Mooring, which is one of the six locations that data for this activity were collected."

    "caption": "A fluorometer measures how much light is emitted by things in the water that previously absorbed light. In other words, by looking at how much light is given off in the water scientists can determine who is in the water and how much of it there is. They are looking for the presence and amount of microscope plants (phytoplankton)."
