    <h4><a href="productivity/index.php">Exploring Primary Production with OOI Data</a></h4>
    <p>Through these activities, we will explore primary production in greater detail. Primary production is the rate at which organisms store energy through the formation of organic matter (carbon-based compounds), using energy derived from solar radiation during photosynthesis or from chemical reactions during chemosynthesis.</p>

    <h4><a href="chemistry/index.php">Exploring Properties of Seawater with OOI Data</a></h4>
    <p>These activities explore properties of seawater in greater detail, to be used as Exploration or Application activities. The properties of seawater explored include: salinity variations over time and space, processes that affect surface seawater salinity, changes in pH with depth, relationship between pH and oceanic pCO<sub>2</sub> for the carbonate buffering system, variations in salinity with depth over time and space, and the depth of the halocline over time and space.</p>

    <p>These activities explore characteristics of seamounts and tectonics in greater detail, to be used as Exploration or Application activities. The properties of seamounts and tectonics explored include: tectonic features and patterns found at divergent and transform boundaries, growth and decay of hydrothermal vents, and tectonic features and patterns of change at seamounts over time.</p>

      <p>Data Explorations are quick (15-20 minute) explorations that are designed to be easily integrated into your current classroom teaching. This site provides a range of interactive activities that incorporate raw data from the OOI that is relevant to concepts you are already teaching in your undergraduate courses.  These explorations were developed and reviewed by faculty to help deepen students' understanding of key oceanographic concepts with real data.</p>
