<h3 style="margin-top:0px;">What are Data Explorations?</h3>
<p>We provide a range of free, interactive Data Explorations using authentic, raw data that is relevant to various concepts you are already teaching in introductory courses. The Data Explorations are quick (15-20 minute) interactions with data so that you can easily integrate them into your current classroom teaching while increasing your students understanding of the concept.</p>

    <h4><a href="productivity/index.php">Exploring Primary Production with Data</a></h4>
    <p>Through these activities, we will explore primary production in greater detail. Primary production is the rate at which organisms store energy through the formation of organic matter (carbon-based compounds), using energy derived from solar radiation during photosynthesis or from chemical reactions during chemosynthesis.</p>
