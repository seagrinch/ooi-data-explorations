    <h3><a href="productivity_index.php">Exploring Primary Productivity with Data</a></h3>
    <p>Through these activities, we will explore primary productivity in greater detail. Primary productivity is the rate at which organisms store energy through the formation of organic matter (carbon-based compounds), using energy derived from solar radiation during photosynthesis or from chemical reactions during chemosynthesis.</p>
