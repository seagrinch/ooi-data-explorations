The instrument on the Central Offshore Profiler Mooring and the Central Inshore Profiler Mooring that collected data in this activity is included in the Wire-Following Profiler (highlighted in purple), which moves along the cable between 15 and 125m below the water surface. Multiple instruments, which are collecting data about many different oceanographic variables, are included in the Wire-Following Profiler. Data for this activity were collected using the CTD instrument."

    "file": "placeholder.png",
    "caption": "The CTD measures and records conductivity, temperature, and pressure (proxy for depth). These parameters can then be used to calculate salinity and density. The CTD is specifically designed to be used to travel up and down between a buoy and a bottom-mounted platform. It is externally powered and memory to store the data temporarily (recovered data). The specific kind of CTD used at the Upstream Inshore Profiler Mooring and Central Inshore Profiler Mooring is a Sea-Bird - SBE 52MP and the Apex Profiler Mooring is a Sea-Bird - SBE 37IM."
