These CTDs are designed to move up and down while it stores (recovered) and communicates data in real time (telemetered). Pioneer has a <a href=\"http://www.seabird.com/sbe52mp-moored-profiler-ctd-dissolved-oxygen-sensor\">Sea-Bird - SBE 52MP</a> and Irminger has a <a href=\"http://www.seabird.com/sbe37im-microcat-CTD\">Sea-Bird - SBE 37IM</a>."
