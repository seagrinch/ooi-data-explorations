<h2>Exploring Tectonics & Seamounts with OOI Data</h2>

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-7">Through these Data Explorations, you can dive deeper into properties of seawater. The properties of seamounts and tectonics explored include: tectonic features and patterns found at divergent and transform boundaries, growth and decay of hydrothermal vents, and tectonic features and patterns of change at seamounts over time.</div>
