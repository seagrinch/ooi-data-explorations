This is a drawing to represent where the different instruments are located in the ocean. Data in this activity were collected from <a href=\"http://oceanobservatories.org/array/cabled-axial-seamount/\">Cabled Axial Seamount</a> (highlighted in white). Axial Seamount is the most advanced underwater volcanic observatory in the world's oceans. This site is the most magmatically robust volcano on the Juan de Fuca Ridge."

There are numerous different instruments at the Axial Seamount, as indicated in the schematic here."

The Broadband Ocean Bottom Seismometers used at the OOI sites are Guralp, model CMG-1T/5T."
